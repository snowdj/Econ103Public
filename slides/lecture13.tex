Estimate total weight of candies by weighing a random sample of size 5 and multiplying the result by 20.

\begin{block}{Your Chance to Win}
The bag of candies and a digital scale will make their way around the room \alert{during the lecture}. Each student gets a chance to draw 5 candies and weigh them.

\begin{block}{Procedure}
When the bag and scale reach you, do the following:
\end{block}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fold the top of the bag over and shake to randomize.
\item Randomly draw 5 candies \alert{without replacement}.
\item Weigh your sample and record the result \alert{in grams} along with your name on the sign-up sheet.
\item Replace your sample and shake again to re-randomize.
\item Pass bag and scale to next person.

\frametitle{Random Sample}

\begin{block}{In Words}
Select sample of $n$ objects from  population so that:
	\begin{enumerate}
\item Each member of the population has the same probability of being selected 
\item The fact that one individual is selected does not affect the chance that any other individual is selected
\item Each sample of size $n$ is equally likely to be selected

\end{enumerate}
\end{block}

\begin{alertblock}{In Math}
	$X_1, X_2, \hdots, X_n \sim \mbox{iid } f(x)$ if continuous\\
  $X_1, X_2, \hdots, X_n \sim \mbox{iid } p(x)$ if discrete

\begin{itemize}
  \item Without replacement $\Rightarrow$ dependence between samples
  \item Sample small relative to popn.\ $\Rightarrow$ dependence negligible.

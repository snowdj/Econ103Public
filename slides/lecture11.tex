For continuous RVs, probability is a matter of finding the area of \emph{intervals}. Individual \emph{points} have \emph{zero} probability.

\section{Probability Density Function (PDF)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Probability Density Function (PDF)}
For a continuous random variable $X$, 
	$$P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f(x) \; dx$$
where $f(x)$ is the \emph{probability density function} for $X$. 
\vspace{2em}

\begin{alertblock}{Extremely Important}
For any realization $x$, $P(X=x) = 0 \neq f(x)$!

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \; dx = 1$ 
\item $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$
\item $f(x)$ is \emph{not} a probability and can be greater than one!
\item $P(X\leq x_0) = F(x_0) = \int_{-\infty}^{x_0} f(x) \; dx $

%About as many boys as girls are born in hospitals. Many babies are born every week at City General. In Cornwall, a country town, there is a small hospital where only a few babies are born every week. A \emph{normal} week is one where between 45\% and 55\% of babies are females. An \emph{unusual} week is one where more than 55\% are girls, or more than 55\% are boys.

%		\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%			\item Unusual weeks occur equally often at City General and at Cornwall.

%You have been called to jury duty in a town where there are two taxi companies, Green Cab Ltd.\ and Blue Taxi Inc. Blue taxi uses cars painted blue; Green Cabs uses green cars. Green cabs dominates the market, with 85\% of the taxis on the road. On a misty winter night a taxi sideswiped another car and drove off. A witness says it was a blue cab. The witness is tested under conditions like those on the night of the accident, and 80\% of the time she correctly reports the color of the cab that is seen. That is, regardless of whether she is shown a blue or a green cab in misty evening light, she gets the color right 80\% of the time.

%    Hardly anyone making up a sequence of 10 tosses puts in a run of 7 heads in a row. It is true that the chance of getting 7 heads in a row with a fair coin is only 1/64. But in tossing a coin 100 times, you have at least 93 chances to start tossing 7 heads in a row, because \alert{each of the first 93 tosses could begin a run of 7.} It is more probable than not, in 100 tosses, that you will get 7 heads in a row. It is certainly more probable than not, that you will get at least 6 heads in a row. Yet almost no one writes down a pretend sequence, in which there are even 6 heads in a row.

%To throw a total of 6 with a pair of dice, you have to get a 1 and a 5, or a 2 and a 4, or a 3 and another 3.
